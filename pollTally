/* Write a program that provides the option of tallying up the results of a poll with 3 possible values. The first input to the program is the poll question, next three are the possible answers. The first answer is indicated by 1, the second by 2, and the third by 3. Results are tallied until a 0 is entered. The program then shows the results of the pool. BONUS: Scalable bar graph. */
